# hbplus_tools
Scripts for processing .hb2 files generated by hbplus analysis of hydrogen bonds in PDB files.
Generate .hb2 file like so:
echo file.pdb | clean 
hbplus -d 3.5 -h 2.7 file.new file.pdb

These scripts will process a PDB structure with both protein and RNA (or DNA) one of two ways.
Either protein-RNA hydrogen bond types can be listed for each nucleotide in the RNA, or
protein-RNA hydrogen bond types can be listed for each amino acid in the protein.

The percent/number of hydrogen bond interacting bases/residues for the protein overall may also be calculated.
